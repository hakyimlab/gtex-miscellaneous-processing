enloc's basic perl implementation is very rigid with the filenames.
Having underscores `_` anywhere in the filename breaks the file name parsing.
I had to convert sQTL dapg intron names from `intron_chr1_1000_1050.txt` to `intron1.txt`

There is a specific file describing the name change for each tissue. Thus the dapg reasults renaming, 
and tghe enloc results renaming.
